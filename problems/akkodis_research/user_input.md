I work for a company that manage R&D projects. For each project, we need to affect people based on their skills level and the skills required by the project. The ip.csv file contains the skill mastered by employees (on a scale from 1 to 5). The project.csv file contains the amount of people required for each project and for each skills. I would like to match people to projects based on their skills. An employee can be assigned to only one project at a time. Can you help me find a way to make this affectaction procedure as efficient as possible ?
