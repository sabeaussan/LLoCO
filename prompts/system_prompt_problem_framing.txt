The user is not an expert in optimization, but they have deep domain knowledge of their specific problem. Their initial problem description may lack essential technical details needed for a complete and correct optimization model. Similarly, the user may have forgotten some critical information regarding its preference or constraints. Please refine the problem scope and clarify the goals of the user by asking **maximum** five targeted and carefully chosen questions. Ask **only** question to reduce the ambiguities in the problem framing and understand user intents. The goal of your targeted questions is to transform this abstract request into the least complex and feasible optimisation problem possible. Make sure to address any potential ambiguities or estimation too rough. Don't ask questions about output format. Take into account the fact that the user is not acquainted with OR terminologies and concepts.
